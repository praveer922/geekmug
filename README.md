# GeekMug

GeekMug is a teacher / student matching website for tutoring, skills classes, both paid and free. Courses can be submitted by any user â€“ either teachers who want their own course publicised on the site, or a user who just wants to link to a course hosted elsewhere. The project also integrates a ranking and review system, to make sure only the best courses show up to the front pages, as well as Google Maps API to show the location of courses nearby.
